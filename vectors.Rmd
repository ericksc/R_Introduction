These are the most basic data objects in R. You can distinguish a total of six atomic types and use them in the most efficient way according to your current situation.

Atomic types: 1. Character 2. Logical 3. Integer 4. Double 5. Complex 6. Raw

Let's create a small script to demonstrate each of these.

```{r}
print("welcome")
print(3.14)
print(100L)
print(FALSE)
print(10+3i)
print(charToRaw('atomic raw'))
```

Executing them will result in the following output.

```{r}

```
